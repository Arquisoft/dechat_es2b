=== Infrastructure Level 1
The infrastructure only has 2 hardware per user: the user's computer with which it access his POD and said POD that rests on SOLID's servers

The deployment is easy as it only needs to be served on the user's computer and to reach the user's POD. As long as SOLID's servers are online and the POD isn't broken then the application will start to work.
