| Aspect | Description | Choice | Explanation
| Programming language | The language used to develop the app is a critical decision due to the fact that it's not possible to change it in the future without causing too much problems. As experience tells us, completely changing the programming language once started is expensive and can cause a project to fail. | TypeScript | The main reason why we have chosen this language is the large quantity of documentation and libraries available. While we were researching about SOLID, we realized that the vast majority of the information is related to TypeScript and JavaScript, and the first one compile to javascript, so we can use javascript's libraries too.
| Framework | Another strength point of a project is the capability of being able to use a framework. A framework used in the good way reduces the time dedicated to code and design. The worst part is the fact of learning how to use it and to know its scope. | Angular | We decided to use Angular because of it's a framework with a high compatibility with the SOLID project, it's oriented to agile methodologies and it's easy to develop graphic interfaces using just 1 window with differents fragments which change in the time.
| Database | The databases are an important utility to save the data, that's why at the beginning of the development we consider whether to use a database that stores the messages, which are stored in the POD through the database, or to use the POD directly.| Use just the POD | The fact of use a database to store the messages and then store the database in the SOLID POD can overload the system doing the same operation (just store data) twice, that's why we decided to write them into the POD directly.
| RDF library | The data stored in the PODs is in RDF format. To facilitate obtaining and writing information from them we can use a library. | N3 | We considered N3 and simpleRDF among others, but finally we decided to use N3 because is the base library used by another libraries and we considered simpler to use than the others apart from the fact that N3 allow more operations than simpleRDF for example.
| Architectural model | We have thought about different architectural models that allow us to achieve the principles of single responsibility, open-closed principle and dependency inversion principle mainly. | Layered Architecture and MVC | We finally decided to use the layered architecture and the model view controller (MVC) because we are familiarized with them and they provide us what we were looking for.
