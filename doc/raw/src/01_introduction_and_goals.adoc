|===
|Nr.|Quality|Motivation
| 1 |Understandability|It needs to be understandable from a programmer that doesn't take part of the development team.
| 2 |Domain based|We focus the application around the model without matters the technologies used.
| 3 |Single Responsability|Due to the nature of the project, it must be easy to make changes on it. It can be reached with the single responsibility principle.
| 4 |Efficiency|As a chat it's important that messages don't take a long time to reach the other side.
| 5 |Security|A decentralized chat wouldnâ€™t be useful to the users if everyone could access to other's chats.
| 6 |Sturdiness|Since this is an important project it needs to be strong, that's why we test the code and prove it with different users.
