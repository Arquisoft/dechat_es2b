== Introduction and Goals



=== Requirements Overview
The driving force behind this project is to pass the subject of Software architecture (https://arquisoft.github.io/) and trying to archive a decent qualification.

The requirements are to make a SOLID based on-line chat by ourselves.

|Nr.|Quality|Motivation
| 1 |Understandability|Since this is a qualifiable project it needs to be understandable from a programmer who doesn't take part of the development team.
| 2 |Efficiency|As a chat it's important that messages don't take a long time to reach the other side.
| 3 |Single Responsability|Due to the nature of the project, it must be easy to make changes on it. It can be reached with the single responsibility principle.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| SOLID team |https://solid.mit.edu/|Their expectations are the same as the teachers' expectations, they want an application that uses SOLID principles. This means to be decentralized.
| ARQUISOFT teachers |https://arquisoft.github.io/| Their expectations are the same as the SOLID team's expectations, they want an application that uses SOLID with the added hurdle of having a limited time and a rigorous use of GitHub.
| The developer team |this GitHub repository| Since we are trying to pass a subject we can consider that every aspect of this project is important to us.
| Individual final users | | The final users of the application are looking for one easy to use and a good response speed.
