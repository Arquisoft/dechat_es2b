== Building Block View

=== Scope & Context

-A user deploys the app on their POD, sets another user as a contact and "sends" a message through the app. That's what is seen from the outside.

=== Level 1

-On the inside, this is done by writing the message that the Emiter wants to send on the Emiter's POD by calling the method AddMessage(message) which calls the repository to write the message and grant the Receptor access to said message. Following that, the Receptor's app gets a warning that indicates that a new message is available so when the method GetMessages() is called it can access it and show it to the Receptor.

=== Level 2

TODO 

=== Whitebox Overall System


The decomposition of the app is motivated by the decision to keep an MVC architecture so every part can be changed if the need arises.
