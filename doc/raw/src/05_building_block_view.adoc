-This is done by writing the message that one user wants to send on that user's POD and then allowing the other user to access said message, then the other user's app gets warned about the new message and then it access it to show it to its user.

=== Whitebox Overall System



With this scheme:

-We have the model at the very center.

-Angular doesn't appear at all, making it replaceable since it's only present on the Interface part.

-We have a stepped structure where each step communicate with the next.

-We can substitute the POD for a mock by changing only a class
