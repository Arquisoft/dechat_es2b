Each figure marked as "Extern" mean to be an external resource. The label "System" represents the application and the users' label the people who use it.

The authentication is made using a request to a SOLID server choosed by the user. The rest of the information (contacts, messages...) are placed in the POD which is in the SOLID server too.

We use the labels "System", "Extern" and "Users" again as we have described in the section before. Moreover, we use a kind of cylinders which represent the SOLID server. The external resource "POD" is the store of the user information.
