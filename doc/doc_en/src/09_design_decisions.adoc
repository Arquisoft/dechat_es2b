| Aspecto | Descripción | Elección | Razonamiento
| Programming Language | The language used to develop the app is a critical decision due to the fact that it's not possible to change it in the future without causing too much problems. As experience tells us, completely changing the programming language once started is expensive and can cause a project to fail | TypeScript | The main reason why we have chosen this language is the large quantity of documentation and libraries available. While we were researching about SOLID, we realized that the vast majority of the information is related to TypeScript and JavaScript
| Framework | Another strength point of a project is the capability of being able to use a framework. A framework used in the good way reduces the time dedicated to code and design. The worst part is the fact of learning how to use it and to know its scope | Angular | We decided to use Angular because of it's a framework with a high compatibility with the SOLID project, it's oriented to agile methodologies and it's easy to develop graphic interfaces using just 1 window with differents fragments which change in the time
| Database | The databases are an important utility to save the data, but at the beginning of the development we consider whether to use a database that stores the messages, and this is stored in the POD, or to use the POD for storage | Do not use a database | You could use a database to store the messages, and then store the database in the SOLID POD, but we believe that this is done twice the work that is not necessary, and also could cause problems to read messages when the other user is not connected
