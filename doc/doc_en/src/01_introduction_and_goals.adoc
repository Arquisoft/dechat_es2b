|Nr.|Quality|Motivation
| 1 |Understability|Since this is a qualifiable project it needs to be undersable from a programmer that isn't part of the development team
| 2 |Eficiency|As a chat it's important that messages don't take a long time to reach the other side.
| 3 |Security|A decentralized chat wouldn't be useful to the users if everyone that wanted to steal information could do it.
