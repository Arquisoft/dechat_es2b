|===
|Nr.|Quality|Motivation
| 1 |Understandability|Since this is a qualifiable project it needs to be understandable from a programmer that isn't part of the development team
| 2 |Efficiency|As a chat it's important that messages don't take a long time to reach the other side.
| 3 |Security|A decentralized chat wouldn't be useful to the users if everyone that wanted to steal information could do it.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| SOLID team |https://solid.mit.edu/|Their expectations are the same as the teachers' expectations, they want an application for PC that uses SOLID and that isn't centralized.
| ARQUISOFT teachers |https://arquisoft.github.io/| Their expectations are the same as the SOLID team's expectations, they want an application for PC that uses SOLID and that isn't centralized with the added hurdle of a time limit and a rigorous use of GitHub.
| The developer team |this GitHub repository| Since we are trying to pass a subject we can consider that every aspect of this project is of most importance for us.
| Individual final users | | The final users of the application will want it to be easy to use, for it to go at a decent speed and for their data to remain private.
| Groups of users | | Groups of users like companies may want conversations to be linked to their web page or to make automated messages in addition to the other requirements.
