== Introduction

As students of the https://github.com/Arquisoft/[Software Architecture course at the University of Oviedo], we were entrusted to develop a decentralized chat as classwork. This chat must be developed using https://solid.inrupt.com[SOLID], the new technology that https://twitter.com/timberners_lee[Tim Berners Lee] presents to us to decentralize the Social Networks in the Web.


== Compile and run

The skeleton project is a simple https://angular.io[Angular] application which can be run as:
----
 ng serve
----

Once executed, the application should be available at: http://127.0.0.1:4200


== Authors and Meetings

The members that we develop in this repo are:

* Enol García González
* Andrés Casillas
* Tomás Argüelles

We make a meeting at least once a week. Every time we meet, we prepare a report with everything that was discussed. All the information can be found in our https://github.com/Arquisoft/dechat_es2b/wiki/Meeting-Book[English meeting book] and our https://github.com/Arquisoft/dechat_es2b/wiki/Libro-de-reuniones[Spanish meeting book]
